<p> About Me: 
&nbsp;
<p> You may have noticed that the name for the header is different, that is because I prefer the name Lane and would like to use it in class if possible. </p> 
<p> Originally I wanted to go into Pre-animation and illustration but the course merged into something new. </p>
<p> Thus leading me to be in this program. I was very nervous at first, as I felt that the only thing I knew how to do was basic photoshop. </p>
<p>Once classes actually started though I felt different, I was excited for all the new knowledge I am obtaining.</p>
<p> Suprisingly enough despite only wanting to do more artistic things with my education, my career goal is to eventually work with animals as they are my biggest passion. </p>
&nbsp;
<p>The quote I chose is by far my favourite quote, I have loved it for the past seven years.</p>
<P>It has been something ive always wanted tattooed so for my 19th birthday I'd like to get it.</p>
<p>I have always found quotes and poetry intreseting, with only a few words it can evoke so many emotions.</p>
<p>Although coding is something I am not completely familiar with this was fun to create, I hope to only continue improving.</p>
<p>I also wanted to thankyou at the end, as I have learned so much your teaching style and formating is so helpful, its helped me create this and I would have never know how to even use html before, so thankyou for reading and helping me create my assignment.</p>

<p>I would say that my two current hobbies are playing video games and drawing.</p>
<p>I play video games nearly everyday and draw every other day, my favourite video game at the moment is called Ooblets and the drawing software im using is photoshop.</p>
