<p> About Me: 
<p> I wanted to use the assignment as a way of saying I prefer the name Lane. <em> 
<p> Originally I wanted to go into Pre-animation and illustration but the course merged into something new <em>
<p> So I went with my other choice which happened to be this program. I was very nervous at first, but after these past weeks it has been alot easier. <em>
<p> Although I want to do more artistic things at school, my job goal is to eventually work with animals as they are my biggest passion.<em>
