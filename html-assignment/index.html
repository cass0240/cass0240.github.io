<p> About Me: 
  &nbsp;
<p> You may have noticed that the name for the header is different, that is because I prefer the name Lane and would like to use it in class if possible. </p> 
<p> Originally I wanted to go into Pre-animation and illustration but the course merged into something new, </p>
<p> so I went with my other choice which happened to be this program. I was very nervous at first, as I felt that the only thing I knew how to do was basic photoshop. </p>
<p>Once classes actually started though I felt different, I was excited for all the new knowledge I am obtaining.</p>
<p> Suprisingly enough despite only wanting to do more artistic things with my education, my career goal is to eventually work with animals as they are my biggest passion. </p>

<body>
<p>The quote I chose is by far my favourite quote, I have loved it for the past seven years.</p>
<P>It has been something ive always wanted tattooed so for my 19th birthday I'd like to get it.</p>
<p>I have always found quotes and poetry intreseting, with only a few words it can evoke so many emotions.</p>
